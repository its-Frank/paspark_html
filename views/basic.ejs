              <h3>Why $10?</h3>
              <p>
                We’ve priced the Basic Plan at $10 to keep it accessible and
                affordable for short-term users. This rate reflects the
                operational costs of maintaining secure, well-monitored parking
                spaces in Eldoret’s prime locations, including technology
                infrastructure for real-time booking and staff support. It’s a
                cost-effective option that balances convenience with value,
                ensuring you don’t overpay for a quick visit. There are no
                hidden fees—what you see is what you get, making it a
                straightforward choice for budget-conscious drivers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The $10 fee also supports our mission to optimize parking
                resources in the city. By charging a modest amount, we can
                sustain our platform, maintain high-quality service, and
                continue expanding our network to serve more drivers. It’s a
                small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing
                your parking spot is secured in advance.
