              <h3>About the Standard Plan</h3>
              <p>
                Our Standard Plan is tailored for those who need a bit more time
                in Eldoret’s city center—up to 5 hours of parking for just $20.
                This plan is ideal for half-day visits, such as business
                meetings, extended shopping trips, or leisurely outings with
                friends. You’ll enjoy the same guaranteed availability and easy
                access as our other plans, with the flexibility to stay longer
                without worrying about time constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the Standard Plan, you can secure a spot in advance through
                our user-friendly online system and relax knowing your parking
                is sorted. It’s designed to accommodate the schedules of
                professionals, students, or anyone spending a significant
                portion of their day in the city. Whether you’re attending a
                seminar or exploring Eldoret’s vibrant downtown, this plan gives
                you the freedom to focus on what matters most.

              <h3>Why $20?</h3>
              <p>
                The $20 price for the Standard Plan reflects the added value of
                extended parking time—up to 5 hours—while keeping costs
                reasonable. This fee covers the maintenance of our parking
                facilities, including security, lighting, and real-time
                monitoring systems, as well as the convenience of reserving a
                spot in high-demand areas. It’s a fair rate for half-day parking
                in a busy urban center like Eldoret, where availability can be
                scarce during peak hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve set this price to strike a balance between affordability
                and sustainability. The $20 helps us maintain a high level of
                service, including customer support and technological upgrades,
                while ensuring we can continue to offer reliable parking
                solutions. It’s an investment in your convenience and our
                commitment to improving parking access for all Eldoret drivers.

              <h3>Who Should Choose This Plan?</h3>
              <p>
                The Standard Plan is perfect for anyone needing parking for up
                to 5 hours. It’s a great choice for professionals with
                mid-length meetings, students attending classes or events, or
                shoppers planning a half-day outing. If you need more time than
                the Basic Plan offers but don’t require all-day parking, this is
                the sweet spot. It’s also ideal for those who want the assurance
                of a reserved spot during busy periods in Eldoret.
