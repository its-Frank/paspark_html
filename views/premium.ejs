              <h3>Why $30?</h3>
              <p>
                The $30 price for the Premium Plan reflects the premium benefits
                it offers: unlimited parking time and priority access to the
                best spots. This fee accounts for the higher operational costs
                of reserving prime spaces in high-demand areas throughout the
                day, as well as enhanced security and maintenance. It’s a
                competitive rate for all-day parking in a city center where
                availability is often limited, especially during peak times.
              </p>
              <p>
                We charge $30 to ensure we can deliver a top-quality experience
                while sustaining our platform’s growth. This includes
                investments in technology, staff, and partnerships with local
                stakeholders to expand our parking network. The price is a
                reflection of the value you receive—unmatched convenience,
                reliability, and the ability to enjoy Eldoret without parking
                worries.

                the best parking experience available.
